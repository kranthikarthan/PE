```

---

### Channel Onboarding UI (Feature 7.11)

**Response Patterns Supported**:
1. âœ… Webhook (HTTP POST callback)
2. âœ… Kafka Topic (high-volume, exactly-once)
3. âœ… WebSocket (real-time)
4. âœ… Polling (REST API status checks)
5. âœ… Push Notification (Firebase/APNs)

**User Journey**:
```
1. Channel admin logs into React portal
2. Clicks "Add Channel"
3. Selects channel type (Partner, Corporate, Branch, etc.)
4. Selects response pattern (Webhook, Kafka, WebSocket, etc.)
5. Configures pattern-specific settings
6. Reviews configuration
7. Tests connection (sends test payment response)
8. Activates channel
9. Payments Engine automatically routes responses based on configuration
```

---

## Security & RBAC

**Roles**:
```yaml
PLATFORM_ADMIN:
  - Full access (all ops features)
  
OPS_ADMIN:
  - Payment repair
  - Service management
  - Circuit breaker control
  
OPS_OPERATOR:
  - Transaction search
  - Reconciliation
  - Monitoring (read-only)
  
OPS_VIEWER:
  - Read-only access (all sections)
```

**API Security**:
- All `/ops/v1/*` endpoints require authentication (JWT with ops role claim)
- Audit log all ops actions (who did what when)
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
- No customer PII in logs (mask account numbers)

---

## Dependencies

### Phase 7 Dependencies

**Phase 7 can start after**:
- âœ… Phase 0: Foundation (database schemas, domain models)
- âœ… Phase 1: Core Services (Payment Initiation, Saga Orchestrator)
- âœ… Phase 3: Platform Services (Reporting, Reconciliation)
- âœ… Phase 5: Infrastructure (Istio, Prometheus, Unleash)
- âœ… Phase 6: Integration & Testing (system validated)

**Parallelization**:
- Backend services (7.1-7.6) can be built in parallel (6 agents)
- Frontend UIs (7.7-7.11) can start after backend APIs are available
- Within frontend, all 5 UIs can be built in parallel (5 agents)

## Fallback Plans

### Backend Fallbacks

| Scenario | Fallback | Mitigation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| K8s API fails | Return mock service health (hardcoded) | Fix in Phase 6 production readiness |
| Prometheus unavailable | Return mock metrics (sample data) | Fix Prometheus integration in Phase 6 |
| Event republishing fails | Allow manual status update + manual event trigger button | Provide manual workaround in UI |
| Elasticsearch unavailable | Use PostgreSQL ILIKE queries (slower) | Deploy Elasticsearch in Phase 6 |

### Frontend Fallbacks

| Scenario | Fallback | Mitigation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Real-time updates fail | Provide manual refresh button | Fix WebSocket connection in Phase 6 |
| Bulk retry fails | Fallback to individual retry with progress bar | Implement batch processing in Phase 6 |
| Drag-and-drop fails | Provide manual matching via form inputs | Simplify UI interaction |
| Test connection fails | Allow channel creation without test | Provide manual test button in channel list |
