## Impact of Rectifications

### Positive Impacts
1. **Accuracy**: Documentation now accurately reflects the implemented architecture
2. **Clarity**: Removed confusion about technologies not actually used
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain documentation that matches reality
4. **Onboarding**: New developers get accurate information about the system

### Considerations
1. **Future Planning**: Some removed technologies might be considered for future implementation
2. **Scalability**: Current monitoring and CI/CD approach may need enhancement for larger scale
3. **Production Readiness**: Manual deployment process may need automation for production

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Complete Rectification**: Review remaining documentation files for similar inconsistencies
2. **Update README Files**: Ensure all README files reflect actual implementation
3. **Code Comments**: Update code comments to match actual implementation

### Medium Term
1. **Consider Automation**: Evaluate implementing automated CI/CD pipeline
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Consider implementing more comprehensive monitoring stack
3. **Security Hardening**: Evaluate additional security tools for production

### Long Term
1. **Cloud Migration**: Consider cloud-native solutions for scalability
2. **Advanced Observability**: Implement comprehensive observability stack
3. **DevOps Maturity**: Move towards GitOps and automated deployment

## Conclusion

The rectification process has successfully aligned the documentation and PlantUML diagrams with the actual implemented architecture. This ensures that developers, architects, and stakeholders have accurate information about the system's current state, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the ISO 20022 Payment Engine.

The system now has a clear, accurate representation of its architecture, focusing on the technologies that are actually implemented and providing a solid foundation for future development and enhancement.
