## 🔧 Priority Fixes Needed for Production

### CRITICAL (Block Production)
- [ ] Implement IAM Service (OAuth 2.0, RBAC)
- [ ] Set up Notification Service (event consumers)
- [ ] Implement Reporting Service (analytics)

### HIGH (Before GA)
- [ ] Centralized Audit Service
- [ ] Tenant Management backend
- [ ] Security audit of all services

### MEDIUM (First iteration)
- [ ] Operations portal backend
- [ ] Channel/Clearing onboarding UIs
- [ ] Performance tuning

---

## 📈 Effort Estimates (Days)

| Task | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| IAM Service | 5 days | 🔴 Critical |
| Notification Service | 4 days | 🔴 Critical |
| Reporting Service | 5 days | 🟠 High |
| Audit Service | 3 days | 🟠 High |
| Tenant Mgmt Backend | 3 days | 🟠 High |
| **Total** | **20 days** | |

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Review detailed assessment: `PHASE-0-3-COMPLETION-ASSESSMENT.md`
2. Start IAM Service implementation
3. Begin Notification Service development
4. Security audit of Phase 1-2 services

### This Quarter
1. Complete all Phase 3 services
2. Run end-to-end testing
3. Load testing (target: 1000+ TPS)
4. Security testing

### Before Production
1. Production readiness checklist
2. Compliance validation
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Disaster recovery testing
