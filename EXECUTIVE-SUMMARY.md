## 💰 Investment Required

### 3-Track Approach (De-Risked)

| Track | Timeline | Cost | Output | Revenue |
|-------|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Track 1: POC** | 4 weeks | $15K | 2 services, demo | $0 (validation) |
| **Track 2: MVP** | 12 weeks | $105K | 8 services, pilots | $50-100K MRR |
| **Track 3: Full** | 24 weeks | $400K | 17 services, 100 banks | $1M+ MRR |
| **Total** | **40 weeks** | **$520K** | **Enterprise platform** | **$1.88M-3.68M/year** |

**ROI**: 72-263% annually (after year 1)  
**Break-even**: < 12 months  
**Payback period**: 6-9 months
