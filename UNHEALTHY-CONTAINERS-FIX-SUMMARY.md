# Quick Fix Summary - Unhealthy Containers

## Problem Found ❌
The `transaction-processing-service` container had an incorrect health check URL that didn't match its Spring Boot context path configuration.

## Root Cause
- **Service Context Path**: `/transaction-processing` (defined in application.yml)
- **Health Check URL**: `http://localhost:8084/transaction-processing-service/actuator/health` ← WRONG
- **Result**: Health check returns 404, container marked as "unhealthy"

## Solution Applied ✅

### File Changed
- **docker-compose.yml** (line 243)

### Before
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8084/transaction-processing-service/actuator/health"]
```

### After
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8084/transaction-processing/actuator/health"]
```

## Verification

✅ docker-compose.yml syntax validated successfully
✅ All service health check URLs now match their context paths
✅ All 6 microservices properly configured

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 60 seconds for startup
sleep 60

# Verify transaction processing service health
curl http://localhost:8085/transaction-processing/actuator/health

# Should return: {"status":"UP",...}
```
