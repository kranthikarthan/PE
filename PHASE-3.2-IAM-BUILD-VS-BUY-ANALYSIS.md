- ✅ Great for user onboarding workflows
- ❌ NOT ideal for OAuth2/token management

**Not Recommended**: For authentication/authorization

---

## 🏗️ BUILD FROM SCRATCH

### Why You'd Consider This:
1. **Custom requirements** not met by existing solutions
2. **Maximum control** over policies
3. **Learning exercise** / proprietary tech
4. **Tight budget** (no $ but lots of time)
5. **Simple needs** (basic JWT validation only)

### What You'd Build (Phase 3.2):
- OAuth2 Authorization Server (AS)
- Resource Server (RS) - token validation
- JWT issuer with RSA key pairs
- User service + role management
- Token refresh/revocation
- MFA support (optional)
- Audit logging

### Estimate: 5 days
- Days 1-2: OAuth2 server setup
- Days 2-3: User/role service
- Days 3-4: Token management & refresh
- Day 5: Testing & hardening

### Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ Security: OAuth2 has many edge cases
- ⚠️ Compliance: You're responsible for certifications
- ⚠️ Maintenance: Updates, vulnerability patches
- ⚠️ Performance: Must handle your TPS

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION FOR PAYMENTS ENGINE

### **HYBRID APPROACH (BEST OPTION)**

**Use Azure AD B2C + Spring Boot OAuth2 Resource Server**

**Why?**
1. ✅ You're already on Azure infrastructure
2. ✅ PCI-DSS pre-certified (payments regulation)
3. ✅ MFA, Conditional Access, fraud detection (payments-critical)
4. ✅ Minimal integration effort (1-2 days)
5. ✅ No infrastructure to manage
6. ✅ Pay-per-authentication (scales with volume)
7. ✅ Focus team on core payment logic, not security plumbing

**Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Azure AD B2C                                             │
│  ├─ User authentication                                 │
│  ├─ MFA, Conditional Access                             │
│  ├─ JWT token issuer (RS256)                           │
│  └─ Managed, pre-certified, compliant                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
                   (JWT token)
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 3.2 IAM Service (Lightweight)                     │
│  ├─ Token validation (via B2C public key)              │
│  ├─ Role mapping (local DB: user → roles)             │
│  ├─ Access control decisions (RBAC)                    │
│  ├─ Audit logging (who accessed what)                 │
│  └─ Multi-tenancy enforcement (X-Tenant-ID)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What Phase 3.2 Would Do**:
- ✅ Validate JWT tokens from B2C
- ✅ Map B2C users to internal roles
- ✅ Check access policies (RBAC)
- ✅ Audit who did what (compliance)
- ✅ Enforce multi-tenancy (X-Tenant-ID)

**Effort**: 2 days
- Day 1: Azure AD B2C setup + Spring OAuth2 config
- Day 2: Role mapping + audit logging + tests
