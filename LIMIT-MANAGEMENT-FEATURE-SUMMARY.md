## ⚠️ New Error Codes

| `MONTHLY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Customer exceeded monthly transaction limit |
| `PAYMENT_TYPE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Exceeded limit for specific payment type |

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### Limit Reservation System
- Prevents race conditions in concurrent transactions
- Reservations expire after 30 minutes if not consumed
- Auto-cleanup scheduled job runs every hour

### Auto-Reset Logic
- **Daily limits**: Reset at midnight (00:00 CAT)
- **Monthly limits**: Reset on 1st of each month
- Scheduled job using Spring `@Scheduled` annotation

### Concurrency Handling
- Database-level pessimistic locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)
- Prevents two concurrent transactions from both passing limit check
- Alternative: Optimistic locking with version field

### Caching Strategy
- Customer limits cached in Redis (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Usage data NOT cached (must be real-time)
- Cache invalidation on limit configuration changes

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Limit Usage Percentage**: `(daily_used / daily_limit) * 100`
2. **Limit Exceeded Rate**: Percentage of payments rejected due to limits
3. **Reservation Expiry Rate**: Percentage of reservations that expire
4. **Average Consumption Time**: Time from reserve to consume

### Alerts
- ⚠️ Customer at 80% of daily limit
- 🚨 Customer at 90% of daily limit
- 🔴 Limit exceeded rate > 10%
- 🔴 Reservation expiry rate > 5%

2. Seed customer_limits table with default profiles
3. Create payment_type_limits for each customer
4. Verify views and stored functions

### Phase 2: Validation Service Enhancement
1. Implement limit checking logic
2. Add reservation/consume/release operations
3. Implement scheduled job for auto-reset
4. Add new API endpoints

### Phase 3: Event Integration
1. Publish LimitConsumedEvent after successful payment
2. Publish LimitReleasedEvent on payment failure
3. Subscribe to events in Notification Service (send alerts at 80% usage)
4. Subscribe to events in Audit Service

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
1. Add limit display component
2. Pre-payment validation
3. User-friendly error messages for limit exceeded
4. Limit usage dashboard

### Phase 5: Testing
1. Unit tests for limit checking logic
2. Integration tests for concurrent transactions
3. Load tests for high-volume scenarios
4. End-to-end tests for full payment flow

### Phase 6: Monitoring
1. Set up metrics collection
2. Create dashboards in Azure Monitor
3. Configure alerts
4. Create runbooks for limit-related issues
