## 🏗️ Saga Implementation Options

### Option 1: Orchestration with Kafka (Recommended)

```
Saga Orchestrator Service
  ↓
Produces: Commands to Kafka topics
  - saga.commands.validate-payment
  - saga.commands.reserve-funds
  - saga.commands.create-transaction
  ↓
Services consume commands → Execute → Publish responses
  ↓
Saga Orchestrator consumes responses → Next step
  ↓
All saga events stored in: saga.payment.events (event sourced)
  ↓
Saga state maintained in: saga.state.payment-saga (compacted topic)
```

**Benefits**:
- Central control and visibility
- Easy to track saga progress
- Straightforward compensation logic
- Complete audit trail

### Option 2: Choreography with Kafka

```
Service A publishes: payment.initiated
  ↓
Service B (listening) → Validates → Publishes: payment.validated
  ↓
Service C (listening) → Reserves → Publishes: funds.reserved
  ↓
... (event chain continues)
```

**Benefits**:
- No central orchestrator (no SPOF)
- Highly decoupled
- Natural event-driven flow
- Better for simple sagas

**Drawbacks**:
- Harder to track overall saga state
- Complex compensation logic
- Difficult to debug

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Kafka Topics Created

```yaml
# Saga Orchestration
saga.payment.commands            # Commands from orchestrator
saga.payment.events              # All saga events (event sourced)
saga.payment.state               # Current state (compacted)
saga.compensate.commands         # Compensation commands
saga.compensated.events          # Compensation results

# Domain Events (32 partitions each)
payment.initiated
payment.validated
account.funds.reserved
routing.determined
transaction.created
clearing.submitted
clearing.completed
payment.completed
payment.failed
limit.consumed
limit.released
```

### Key Configuration

```yaml
# Exactly-Once Semantics
producer:
  acks: all
  enable-idempotence: true
  transactional-id: saga-orchestrator-${INSTANCE_ID}

consumer:
  isolation-level: read_committed
  enable-auto-commit: false

# Kafka Streams (State Management)
streams:
  processing.guarantee: exactly_once_v2
  num.stream.threads: 4
```

### Event Sourcing Code

```java
// Rebuild saga state from event log
public SagaState rebuildState(String sagaId) {
    // Replay all events for this saga
    List<SagaEvent> events = readEventsFromKafka(sagaId);
    
    SagaState state = new SagaState();
    for (SagaEvent event : events) {
        state = state.apply(event);
    }
    
    return state;
}
```

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Monthly Costs

| Option | Cost | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Azure Service Bus** | $650 | < 50K msg/sec, simple pub/sub |
| **Confluent Cloud** | $2,700 | 100K+ msg/sec, managed Kafka |
| **Self-Hosted Kafka** | $3,600 | Full control, high volume |
| **Azure Event Hubs (Kafka)** | $1,200 | Azure-native Kafka protocol |

### ROI Analysis

**When Kafka Makes Sense**:
- Throughput > 100,000 msg/sec
- Event sourcing saves development time
- Event replay prevents data loss incidents
- Exactly-once prevents duplicate payments

**When Service Bus Makes Sense**:
- Lower throughput
- Simpler architecture
- Azure-native preferred
- Cost optimization priority

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### Throughput Test (Payment Sagas)

| Platform | Saga Start Rate | Saga Completion Rate | p95 Latency |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Azure Service Bus | 5,000/sec | 4,800/sec | 150ms |
| Confluent Kafka | 50,000/sec | 48,000/sec | 50ms |

### Scalability

| Metric | Service Bus | Kafka |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Max Topics | 1,000 | Unlimited |
| Max Partitions/Topic | 100 | 10,000+ |
| Max Consumers | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Message Size | 1 MB | 10 MB (configurable) |
| Concurrent Sagas | ~10,000 | ~1,000,000 |

---

## 🚀 Migration Path

### Phase 1: Start with Azure Service Bus (Current)
```
Benefits:
✅ Faster to implement
✅ Lower initial cost
✅ Azure-native
✅ Simpler operations

Timeline: Now - 6 months
Cost: $650/month
```

### Phase 2: Evaluate Performance
```
Monitor:
- Message throughput
- Saga completion rate
- Event replay needs
- Cost per transaction

Decision Point: 6 months
```

### Phase 3: Migrate to Kafka (If Needed)
```
Triggers:
- Throughput > 100K msg/sec
- Need event sourcing
- Event replay critical
- Cost per msg lower with Kafka

Timeline: Month 7-9
Cost: $2,700/month (but higher value)
```

### Dual-Write Pattern (Migration)

```java
// During migration: write to both
public void publishEvent(Event event) {
    // Write to Service Bus
    serviceBusTemplate.send("topic", event);
    
    // Write to Kafka
    kafkaTemplate.send("topic", event.getKey(), event);
    
    // Gradually shift consumers from Service Bus to Kafka
}
```

---

## 🎯 Saga Pattern Implementations

### Orchestration (Works with Both)

```
Central Saga Orchestrator
├── Sends: Commands
├── Receives: Responses
├── Maintains: State
└── Triggers: Compensation

Platform: Azure Service Bus OR Kafka
Code: Same business logic, different transport
```

### Choreography (Kafka Only)

```
No Central Orchestrator
├── Services: React to events
├── Event Chain: payment.initiated → validated → reserved → ...
├── State: Distributed across services
└── Compensation: Reverse event chain

Platform: Kafka only (needs event replay)
Code: Different pattern, more distributed
```

---

## 📝 Code Changes Required

### Abstract Event Publisher (Support Both)

```java
// Interface (platform-agnostic)
public interface EventPublisher {
    void publish(String topic, String key, Event event);
}

// Azure Service Bus Implementation
@Service
@Profile("servicebus")
public class ServiceBusEventPublisher implements EventPublisher {
    @Autowired
    private ServiceBusTemplate serviceBusTemplate;
    
    public void publish(String topic, String key, Event event) {
        serviceBusTemplate.send(topic, event);
    }
}

// Kafka Implementation
@Service
@Profile("kafka")
public class KafkaEventPublisher implements EventPublisher {
    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, Event> kafkaTemplate;
    
    public void publish(String topic, String key, Event event) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, key, event);
    }
}

// Saga Orchestrator uses interface (platform-agnostic)
@Service
public class SagaOrchestrator {
    @Autowired
    private EventPublisher eventPublisher;  // Injected based on profile
    
    public void executeStep(String sagaId, String stepName, Object payload) {
        eventPublisher.publish("saga.commands", sagaId, command);
    }
}
```

## 📊 Decision Matrix

### Choose Azure Service Bus If:

| Criteria | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Expected Throughput | < 50,000 msg/sec |
| Team Kafka Experience | Low |
| Azure-Native Preference | High |
| Budget Constraint | Tight |
| Event Sourcing Need | Low |
| Time to Market | Short |

**Example**: Starting a new payments engine, want to launch quickly, moderate volume.

### Choose Confluent Kafka If:

| Criteria | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Expected Throughput | > 100,000 msg/sec |
| Team Kafka Experience | High |
| Event Sourcing Need | Critical |
| Event Replay Required | Yes |
| Exactly-Once Required | Yes |
| Long-Term Event Retention | Yes (> 1 year) |

**Example**: Scaling to millions of transactions, need event sourcing, have Kafka expertise.

### Hybrid Approach (Use Both):

- **Kafka**: Saga orchestration, event sourcing, high-throughput events
- **Service Bus**: Notifications, low-volume critical messages

**Example**: Large enterprise with complex requirements and budget.

## 🔄 Architecture with Kafka

### Saga Orchestrator Service

```java
@Service
public class KafkaPaymentSagaOrchestrator {
    
    // Kafka producer for commands
    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, SagaCommand> commandProducer;
    
    // Kafka Streams state store
    @Autowired
    private ReadOnlyKeyValueStore<String, SagaState> sagaStateStore;
    
    // Start saga
    public String startPaymentSaga(PaymentRequest request) {
        String sagaId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        
        // Publish SAGA_STARTED event (event sourcing)
        publishEvent(sagaId, "SAGA_STARTED", request);
        
        // Publish first command
        publishCommand(sagaId, "VALIDATE_PAYMENT", request);
        
        return sagaId;
    }
    
    // Listen to service responses
    @KafkaListener(topics = "saga.responses.payment-validated")
    public void onPaymentValidated(SagaResponse response) {
        String sagaId = response.getSagaId();
        
        // Publish STEP_COMPLETED event
        publishEvent(sagaId, "STEP_COMPLETED", response);
        
        // Execute next step
        publishCommand(sagaId, "RESERVE_FUNDS", response.getPayload());
    }
    
    // Handle failures and compensation
    @KafkaListener(topics = "saga.responses.*.failed")
    public void onStepFailed(SagaResponse response) {
        String sagaId = response.getSagaId();
        
        // Start compensation
        publishEvent(sagaId, "COMPENSATION_STARTED", response.getError());
        
        // Trigger compensating transactions
        compensate(sagaId);
    }
}
```

### Kafka Topics for Payment Saga

## 💾 Event Sourcing with Kafka

### Store Every Saga State Change

```
Saga: PAY-2025-XXXXXX

Event 1: SAGA_STARTED
Event 2: STEP_STARTED (VALIDATE_PAYMENT)
Event 3: STEP_COMPLETED (VALIDATE_PAYMENT)
Event 4: STEP_STARTED (RESERVE_FUNDS)
Event 5: STEP_COMPLETED (RESERVE_FUNDS)
Event 6: STEP_STARTED (CREATE_TRANSACTION)
Event 7: STEP_FAILED (CREATE_TRANSACTION)
Event 8: COMPENSATION_STARTED
Event 9: COMPENSATING_STEP (RELEASE_FUNDS)
Event 10: COMPENSATION_COMPLETED
Event 11: SAGA_COMPENSATED

All stored in Kafka topic: saga.payment.events
Retention: 7 years (compliance)
```

### Rebuild State from Events

```java
// Get saga state at any point in time
public SagaState getSagaStateAt(String sagaId, Instant timestamp) {
    
    // Read events up to timestamp
    List<SagaEvent> events = readEvents(sagaId, timestamp);
    
    // Replay events
    SagaState state = new SagaState();
    for (SagaEvent event : events) {
        if (event.getTimestamp().isBefore(timestamp)) {
            state = state.apply(event);
        }
    }
    
    return state; // State as it was at that timestamp
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Resilience Features

### Exactly-Once Semantics

```java
@Transactional("kafkaTransactionManager")
public void executeStepWithTransaction(String sagaId, String stepName) {
    
    // All operations in single Kafka transaction
    
    // 1. Publish command
    kafkaTemplate.send("saga.commands." + stepName, sagaId, command);
    
    // 2. Record event
    kafkaTemplate.send("saga.payment.events", sagaId, event);
    
    // 3. Update state
    kafkaTemplate.send("saga.payment.state", sagaId, newState);
    
    // If any fails, all are rolled back
}
```

### Consumer Idempotency

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "saga.responses.payment-validated")
public void onPaymentValidated(
    ConsumerRecord<String, SagaResponse> record,
    Acknowledgment ack
) {
    String sagaId = record.key();
    SagaResponse response = record.value();
    
    // Check if already processed (idempotency)
    if (isEventProcessed(response.getEventId())) {
        log.info("Event already processed: {}", response.getEventId());
        ack.acknowledge();
        return;
    }
    
    try {
        // Process event
        processResponse(sagaId, response);
        
        // Mark as processed
        markEventProcessed(response.getEventId());
        
        // Commit offset
        ack.acknowledge();
        
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("Failed to process event", e);
        // Don't acknowledge - will retry
    }
}
```
