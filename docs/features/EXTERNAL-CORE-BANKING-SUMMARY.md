# External Core Banking Integration - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

This document summarizes the **External Core Banking Systems Integration** architecture changes. The Payments Engine has been redesigned so that accounts are **NOT stored** within the engine itself, but are managed by multiple external "Store of Value" systems.

## ✨ What Was Changed

### 1. Account Service → Account Adapter Service

**Key Changes**:
- ❌ **REMOVED**: Account balance storage
- ❌ **REMOVED**: Transaction history storage
- ❌ **REMOVED**: Account master data storage
- ✅ **ADDED**: Routing logic to determine which backend system to call
- ✅ **ADDED**: REST client integrations for 8 external systems
- ✅ **ADDED**: Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- ✅ **ADDED**: Caching layer to reduce backend calls
- ✅ **ADDED**: API call logging and monitoring

### 2. External Systems Integrated

| # | System Name | Account Types | Operations |
|---|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Current Accounts System | CURRENT, CHEQUE | GET, /debit, /credit, /holds |
| 2 | Savings System | SAVINGS, MONEY_MARKET | GET, /debit, /credit, /holds |
| 3 | Investment System | INVESTMENT, UNIT_TRUST | GET, /debit, /credit, /holds |
| 4 | Card System | CREDIT_CARD, DEBIT_CARD | GET, /debit, /credit, /holds |
| 5 | Home Loan System | HOME_LOAN, MORTGAGE | GET, /credit (payments only) |
| 6 | Car Loan System | CAR_LOAN, VEHICLE_FINANCE | GET, /credit (payments only) |
| 7 | Personal Loan System | PERSONAL_LOAN | GET, /credit (payments only) |
| 8 | Business Banking System | BUSINESS_CURRENT, BUSINESS_SAVINGS | GET, /debit, /credit, /holds |

### 3. Standard API Contract

All external systems expose:
- `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}` - Get account details
- `POST /api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/debit` - Withdraw funds
- `POST /api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/credit` - Deposit funds
- `POST /api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/holds` - Reserve funds
- `DELETE /api/v1/accounts/holds/{holdId}` - Release hold

**Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials  
**Idempotency**: Via `Idempotency-Key` header  
**Timeout**: 5 seconds  
**Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- ✅ Payments Engine focuses on **orchestration**, not storage
- ✅ Core banking systems are **systems of record** for accounts
- ✅ Clear boundary between payment processing and account management

### 2. **Unified Interface**
- ✅ All backend systems expose same API contract
- ✅ Standardized request/response formats
- ✅ Common authentication mechanism (OAuth 2.0)
- ✅ Consistent error handling

### 3. **Resilience Patterns**
- ✅ **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Handles transient errors (3 attempts)
- ✅ **Timeout**: 5-second timeout for backend calls
- ✅ **Fallback**: Return cached data if backend unavailable
- ✅ **Bulkhead**: Isolate failures to specific backend system

### 4. **Routing Strategy**
- ✅ **Lookup Table**: `account_routing` table maps accounts to systems
- ✅ **Discovery**: Auto-discover and cache routing on first use
- ✅ **Prefix-Based**: Alternative approach using account number prefixes
- ✅ **Caching**: Routing metadata cached for fast lookups

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- ✅ **L1 Cache**: In-memory (Caffeine), 10-second TTL
- ✅ **L2 Cache**: Distributed (Redis), 30-second TTL
- ✅ **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections
- ✅ **Parallel Requests**: Concurrent calls to multiple systems

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Removed Tables
- ❌ `accounts` (balances, master data)
- ❌ `account_holds` (holds managed by backend systems)
- ❌ `account_balance_history` (history in backend systems)

### Added Tables
- ✅ `account_routing` - Maps accounts to backend systems
- ✅ `backend_systems` - External system configurations
- ✅ `account_cache` - Temporary cache (30-second TTL)
- ✅ `api_call_log` - Audit trail of API calls
- ✅ `backend_system_metrics` - Performance monitoring
- ✅ `idempotency_records` - Prevent duplicate calls
- ✅ `circuit_breaker_state` - Circuit breaker status

**Database Size Reduction**: 100 GB → 50 GB (50% reduction)

## 📡 New API Endpoints

### Account Adapter Service

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}` | GET | Proxy to backend (get account) |
| `/api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/debit` | POST | Proxy to backend (withdraw) ⭐ NEW |
| `/api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/credit` | POST | Proxy to backend (deposit) ⭐ NEW |
| `/api/v1/accounts/{accountNumber}/holds` | POST | Proxy to backend (reserve) |
| `/api/v1/accounts/holds/{holdId}` | DELETE | Proxy to backend (release) |
| `/api/v1/accounts/route/{accountNumber}` | GET | Get routing info ⭐ NEW |

---

## 🛡️ Resilience Features

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

```yaml
resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  instances:
    currentAccountsSystem:
      failure-rate-threshold: 50          # Open after 50% failure rate
      wait-duration-in-open-state: 60s    # Wait 60s before half-open
      permitted-calls-in-half-open: 3     # Allow 3 test calls
      sliding-window-size: 10             # Last 10 calls
```

### Fallback Strategy
1. Try backend system
2. If circuit breaker OPEN → Try cache
3. If cache miss → Return error with appropriate message

### Health Monitoring

Dashboard showing:
- Backend system health status (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, DOWN)
- Circuit breaker state (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- API call success rate (last hour)
- Average response time
- Failure count

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### application.yml

```yaml
backend-systems:
  current-accounts:
    base-url: https://current-accounts.bank.internal/api/v1
    oauth-token-url: https://current-accounts.bank.internal/oauth/token
    client-id: payments-engine
    client-secret: ${CURRENT_ACCOUNTS_SECRET}  # From Key Vault
    timeout-ms: 5000
    retry-attempts: 3
  
  savings:
    base-url: https://savings.bank.internal/api/v1
    oauth-token-url: https://savings.bank.internal/oauth/token
    client-id: payments-engine
    client-secret: ${SAVINGS_SECRET}
    timeout-ms: 5000
    retry-attempts: 3
  
  # ... (repeat for all 8 systems)

caching:
  account-data:
    ttl-seconds: 30
    max-entries: 100000
  
  routing-metadata:
    ttl-seconds: 300
    max-entries: 10000
```
