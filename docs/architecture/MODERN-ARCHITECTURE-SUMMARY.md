## ⭐ Patterns to ADD (Recommended)

### Priority: HIGH (Phase 1 - Before Production)

#### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Strategic design with Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Domain Events, Ubiquitous Language

**Why add it**:
- ✅ You already have implicit bounded contexts (formalize them)
- ✅ Payment domain is complex
- ✅ Multi-tenant adds complexity
- ✅ External integrations need Anti-Corruption Layers

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**ROI**: Very High (code quality, maintainability)

**Example**:
```java
// Aggregate Root: Payment
public class Payment {
    private PaymentId id;
    private Money amount;
    private PaymentStatus status;
    
    // Business methods (not getters/setters!)
    public void initiate(PaymentDetails details) {
        if (this.status != PaymentStatus.DRAFT) {
            throw new PaymentAlreadyInitiatedException();
        }
        this.status = PaymentStatus.INITIATED;
        registerEvent(new PaymentInitiatedEvent(this.id));
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Separate API Gateway for each client type (Web, Mobile, Partner APIs)

**Why add it**:
- ✅ Different clients need different data shapes
- ✅ Mobile needs smaller payloads
- ✅ Partners need different authentication

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**ROI**: High (client experience)

**Architecture**:
```
Web Portal → Web BFF (GraphQL) → Microservices
Mobile App → Mobile BFF (REST) → Microservices
Partner APIs → Partner BFF (REST + OAuth) → Microservices
```

#### 3. **Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Track requests across multiple services with OpenTelemetry

**Why add it**:
- ✅ 20 microservices (complex request paths)
- ✅ Debug distributed transactions
- ✅ Identify bottlenecks

**Effort**: 1 week  
**ROI**: Very High (observability)

**Example**:
```
TraceID: abc-123
├─ API Gateway (10ms)
├─ Payment Service (50ms)
├─ Validation Service (150ms) ⚠️ SLOW
├─ Account Adapter (80ms)
└─ Saga Orchestrator (30ms)

Total: 320ms
Bottleneck: Validation Service
```

---

### Priority: MEDIUM (Phase 2 - Production Hardening)

#### 4. **Service Mesh (Istio)** ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication (mTLS, traffic management, observability)

**Why add it**:
- ✅ 20 microservices (complex communication)
- ✅ Running on Kubernetes (natural fit)
- ✅ Multi-tenant requires strong security

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**ROI**: High (security, resilience)

**Provides**:
- Automatic mTLS between all services
- Circuit breaking (no code changes)
- Canary deployments
- Advanced load balancing
- Built-in distributed tracing

#### 5. **Reactive Architecture (Spring WebFlux)** ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Non-blocking, asynchronous programming model with backpressure

**Why add it** (selectively):
- ✅ High transaction volumes (100K+ TPS potential)
- ✅ I/O-bound operations (database, external APIs)
- ✅ Better resource utilization

**Effort**: 3-4 weeks (selective adoption)  
**ROI**: High (performance)

**Performance Comparison**:
| Aspect | Traditional | Reactive |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Throughput | 5,000 req/sec | 50,000 req/sec |
| Scalability | Thread-limited | CPU/memory limited |

**Use for**: Payment Initiation, Validation, Account Adapter (high-volume services)  
**Don't use for**: Saga Orchestrator, Reporting (batch processing)

#### 6. **GitOps (ArgoCD)** ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is**: Git as single source of truth for infrastructure/applications (declarative, automatic sync)

**Why add it**:
- ✅ 20 microservices to manage
- ✅ Multi-tenant (complex configuration)
- ✅ Need audit trail and rollback

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**ROI**: Medium (DevOps efficiency)

**Benefits**:
- Git as audit trail
- Easy rollback (revert commit)
- Automatic sync (no manual kubectl)
- Environment parity

---

### Priority: LOW (Phase 3 - Scale)

#### 7. **Cell-Based Architecture** ⭐⭐

**What it is**: System divided into cells (self-contained units), each handling subset of tenants

**Why add it** (at scale):
- ✅ When you have 50+ tenants
- ✅ Need blast radius containment
- ✅ Regional deployment

**Effort**: 4-6 weeks  
**ROI**: Medium (only needed at scale)

**Architecture**:
```
Cell 1: Standard Bank, Nedbank (50K TPS)
Cell 2: Absa, FNB (50K TPS)
Cell 3: Other banks (50K TPS)

Each cell: Complete stack (17 services + DB)
```
