# Performance Monitoring & Alerting Strategy
## High TPS Payment Engine Monitoring

### Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategy for the Payment Engine to support 2000+ TPS operations with real-time visibility into system performance, business metrics, and operational health.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### 1. **Transaction Processing Metrics**
- **TPS (Transactions Per Second)**: Target 2000 TPS
- **Response Time**: P95 < 2 seconds, P99 < 5 seconds
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate
- **Throughput**: Transactions per minute/hour

#### 2. **System Performance Metrics**
- **CPU Usage**: < 80% average
- **Memory Usage**: < 85% of allocated memory
- **Database Connections**: < 80% of pool capacity
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 95% for critical caches

#### 3. **Business Metrics**
- **Total Amount Processed**: Daily/monthly volumes
- **Average Transaction Amount**: For trend analysis
- **High-Value Transactions**: Count and amount
- **Fee Collection**: Total fees collected

### Monitoring Architecture

#### 1. **Metrics Collection**
```yaml
# Prometheus Configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'payment-engine'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['payment-engine:8080']

```

### Performance Testing & Validation

#### 1. **Load Testing Scripts**
```javascript
// k6 Load Test for 2000 TPS
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },   // Ramp up to 100 TPS
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },   // Stay at 100 TPS
    { duration: '2m', target: 500 },   // Ramp up to 500 TPS
    { duration: '5m', target: 500 },   // Stay at 500 TPS
    { duration: '2m', target: 1000 },  // Ramp up to 1000 TPS
    { duration: '5m', target: 1000 },  // Stay at 1000 TPS
    { duration: '2m', target: 2000 },  // Ramp up to 2000 TPS
    { duration: '10m', target: 2000 }, // Stay at 2000 TPS
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },     // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<2000'], // 95% of requests under 2s
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],    // Error rate under 1%
  },
};

export default function() {
  let payload = JSON.stringify({
    fromAccountId: 'test-account-1',
    toAccountId: 'test-account-2',
    paymentTypeId: 'test-payment-type',
    amount: 100.00,
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    description: 'Load test transaction'
  });

  let params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer test-token',
    },
  };

  let response = http.post('http://payment-engine/api/v1/transactions', payload, params);
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 201': (r) => r.status === 201,
    'response time < 2s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 2000,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
```

#### 2. **Performance Benchmarks**
- **Baseline**: 50-100 TPS
- **Phase 1**: 100-300 TPS (3x improvement)
- **Phase 2**: 300-600 TPS (6x improvement)
- **Phase 3**: 600-1000 TPS (10x improvement)
- **Phase 4**: 1000-1500 TPS (15x improvement)
- **Phase 5**: 1500-2000 TPS (20x improvement)

### Monitoring Best Practices

#### 1. **Metric Naming Conventions**
- Use consistent naming: `service_component_metric_type`
- Include service name: `payment_engine_`
- Use descriptive names: `transactions_processed_total`
- Include units: `response_time_seconds`

#### 2. **Dashboard Design**
- Keep dashboards focused on specific use cases
- Use appropriate time ranges (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d)
- Include both current values and trends
- Use color coding for status (green/yellow/red)

#### 3. **Alerting Best Practices**
- Set appropriate thresholds based on historical data
- Use different severity levels (critical/warning/info)
- Include runbook links in alert descriptions
- Test alerting channels regularly

#### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
- Monitor both application and infrastructure metrics
- Track business metrics alongside technical metrics
- Use percentiles for response time monitoring
- Monitor error rates and error types

### Incident Response

#### 1. **Alert Escalation**
- **Critical**: Immediate notification to on-call engineer
- **Warning**: Notification to team lead within 15 minutes
- **Info**: Daily summary report

#### 2. **Runbook Procedures**
- **High TPS**: Check system resources, scale if needed
- **High Error Rate**: Check logs, investigate root cause
- **High Response Time**: Check database, cache, and network
- **System Down**: Check infrastructure, restart services

#### 3. **Post-Incident Analysis**
- Document incident details and timeline
- Identify root cause and contributing factors
- Implement preventive measures
- Update monitoring and alerting rules

### Continuous Improvement

#### 1. **Regular Reviews**
- Weekly performance review meetings
- Monthly capacity planning sessions
- Quarterly architecture reviews
- Annual performance optimization projects

#### 2. **Metric Analysis**
- Trend analysis for capacity planning
- Correlation analysis for performance optimization
- Anomaly detection for proactive monitoring
- Business impact analysis for prioritization

#### 3. **Tool Optimization**
- Regular updates to monitoring tools
- Performance tuning of monitoring infrastructure
- Integration with new tools and technologies
- Training and knowledge sharing

This monitoring strategy provides comprehensive visibility into the Payment Engine's performance and enables proactive management of the system to maintain 2000+ TPS operations reliably.
