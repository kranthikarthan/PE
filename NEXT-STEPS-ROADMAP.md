**Tasks**:
1. Domain Model (2 days) - Create Payment entity, Money value object
2. Repository (1 day) - PaymentRepository, Flyway migration
3. Service Layer (2 days) - PaymentService, business logic
4. API Layer (1 day) - PaymentController, DTOs
5. Tests (1 day) - Unit tests, integration tests

**Time**: 1 week  
**Cost**: $10K  
**Team**: 2 engineers  

---

#### **Option B: AI-Agent Implementation** (Recommended)

**Setup AI Agent Orchestrator**:

```python
# Create: tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py

from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

def generate_domain_model(spec):
    """Generate domain model from specification"""
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a Java Spring Boot domain model based on this specification:
    
    {spec}
    
    Requirements:
    - Use JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Id)
    - Include validation annotations (@NotNull, @Size)
    - Add equals(), hashCode(), toString()
    - Include JavaDoc comments
    - Follow DDD principles (entity, value object, aggregate)
    """
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a senior Java developer specializing in DDD and Spring Boot."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        temperature=0.3
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage
payment_spec = """
Payment Entity:
- Fields: paymentId (UUID), amount (Money), status (enum), tenantId, createdAt
- Validations: amount > 0, status not null
- Aggregate root: Payment
"""

payment_code = generate_domain_model(payment_spec)
print(payment_code)
```

**Step-by-Step AI Implementation**:

```bash
1. Install Dependencies
   pip install openai anthropic
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

2. Generate Domain Model
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=domain-model \
     --spec=docs/02-MICROSERVICES-BREAKDOWN.md \
     --service=payment-service \
     --output=services/payment-service/src/main/java/com/paymentsengine/payment/domain/

3. Generate Repository
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=repository \
     --spec=docs/05-DATABASE-SCHEMAS.md \
     --service=payment-service \
     --output=services/payment-service/src/main/java/com/paymentsengine/payment/repository/

4. Generate Service Layer
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=service \
     --spec=docs/02-MICROSERVICES-BREAKDOWN.md \
     --service=payment-service \
     --output=services/payment-service/src/main/java/com/paymentsengine/payment/service/

5. Generate API Layer
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=api \
     --spec=docs/02-MICROSERVICES-BREAKDOWN.md \
     --service=payment-service \
     --output=services/payment-service/src/main/java/com/paymentsengine/payment/controller/

6. Generate Tests
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=tests \
     --service=payment-service \
     --output=services/payment-service/src/test/java/
```

**Time**: 2 days (including review)  
**Cost**: $500 (AI credits) + $2K (human review)  
**Team**: 1 engineer (review only)  

**Savings**: $7.5K (75% cost reduction) ✅

---

**Checklist (Week 2)**:
- [ ] Payment Service code complete (all layers)
- [ ] Unit tests written (> 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests written (database, Kafka)
- [ ] Service builds successfully (mvn clean install)
- [ ] Service runs locally (http://localhost:8080/actuator/health)

**Output**: Working Payment Service ✅

---

### Week 3: Build Second Service + Integration

#### **Build Validation Service** (Similar to Week 2)

```bash
1. Generate Validation Service (AI Agent)
   python tools/agent-orchestrator/orchestrator.py \
     --task=full-service \
     --spec=docs/02-MICROSERVICES-BREAKDOWN.md \
     --service=validation-service \
     --output=services/validation-service/

2. Review and Refine (Human)
   - Review business logic (fraud rules, limit checks)
   - Add edge cases
   - Optimize queries

3. Build and Test
   cd services/validation-service
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### **Integrate Payment + Validation Services**

```java
// In Payment Service: Call Validation Service

@Service
public class PaymentService {
    
    private final ValidationServiceClient validationClient;
    
    public Payment initiatePayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        // Step 1: Create payment entity
        Payment payment = Payment.create(request);
        
        // Step 2: Call Validation Service
        ValidationResult result = validationClient.validate(
            ValidationRequest.from(payment)
        );
        
        if (!result.isValid()) {
            throw new ValidationException(result.getErrors());
        }
        
        // Step 3: Save payment
        payment.markAsValidated();
        return paymentRepository.save(payment);
    }
}

// Create: ValidationServiceClient

@Component
public class ValidationServiceClient {
    
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate;
    
    @Value("${validation.service.url}")
    private String validationServiceUrl;
    
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "validation-service", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public ValidationResult validate(ValidationRequest request) {
        return restTemplate.postForObject(
            validationServiceUrl + "/api/v1/validate",
            request,
            ValidationResult.class
        );
    }
    
    public ValidationResult fallback(ValidationRequest request, Exception e) {
        // Return degraded validation (accept with flag)
        return ValidationResult.degraded();
    }
}
```

**Checklist (Week 3)**:
- [ ] Validation Service complete
- [ ] Payment Service calls Validation Service (REST)
- [ ] Circuit breaker configured (Resilience4j)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (both services running)
- [ ] End-to-end flow works (payment → validation)

**Output**: 2 services integrated ✅

---

### Week 4: Deploy to Azure + Demo

   RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests
   
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   EXPOSE 8080

2. Build and Push to Azure Container Registry
   
   # Create ACR
   az acr create \
     --resource-group rg-payments-engine-dev \
     --name acrpaymentsdev \
     --sku Basic
   
   # Build image
   docker build -t payment-service:v1 .

## 📊 Decision Framework

### After Track 1 (4 Weeks):

```
✅ PROCEED TO TRACK 2 IF:
├─ 2 services working end-to-end
├─ Deployed to Azure successfully
├─ Performance acceptable (< 200ms latency)
├─ Team confident in approach
├─ Stakeholders satisfied with demo
└─ Budget available ($105K for Track 2)

⚠️ ITERATE IF:
├─ Services working but performance issues
├─ Team needs more training
├─ Architecture adjustments needed
└─ Minor issues to fix

❌ STOP IF:
├─ Fundamental architecture problems
├─ Technology stack not suitable
├─ Team cannot execute
└─ Budget constraints
```

### After Track 2 (16 Weeks Total):

```
✅ PROCEED TO TRACK 3 IF:
├─ 8 services working in production
├─ Pilot customers (5-10 banks) onboarded
├─ Performance meets SLOs (50K req/sec)
├─ Security hardened (penetration test passed)
├─ Revenue validated (pilot customers paying)
└─ Budget available ($400K for Track 3)

⚠️ OPTIMIZE IF:
├─ Pilot successful but needs optimization
├─ Scale pilot to more customers (50 banks)
└─ Delay Track 3, focus on revenue

❌ STOP IF:
├─ Pilot customers not satisfied
├─ Performance not meeting expectations
└─ Business case not validated
```
